BrainBeacon: Cross-species foundation model for brain spatial transcriptomics.

![BrainBeacon Overview](./docs/BrainBeacon_Overview.tiff)

## Overview
BrainBeacon is a cross-species foundation model designed to integrate spatial transcriptomics data from multiple species and platforms. It provides a unified representation of spatially organized gene expression patterns and cellular microenvironments, enabling comparative analyses across the mammalian brain.

## Data
The spatial transcriptomics datasets used for training and evaluation are hosted on Zenodo.
